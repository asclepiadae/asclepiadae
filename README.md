### <p align="center">⚙️ My development environment </p>

> My father was an early tech adopter, and I grew up with Windows PCs - my first video-game memory is watching him make a real-time flight at night in Microsoft Flight Sim 95! It’s my day-to-day operating system, where I make use of everything from Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and the Windows Terminal, to EVGA-powered gaming fun.
